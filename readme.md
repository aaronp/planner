# planner

This is a venure planning calculator available [here](https://aaronp.github.io/planner/)

The storage is completely in-browser with a data import/export and PDF download.

It lets you model various costs and potential revenue streams to help
answer important investment questions such as:

 * "When will we be operationally profitable?"
 * "When will I get my money back? (i.e. a return on investment)"
 * "What will the ROI be in 1, 2, ... N years' time?"
 * "What valuation can I expect?"

 As those answers can change dramatically based on all manner of factors,
 so this planner let's you adjust the answers based on individual risk profiles and scenarios.

 There is a built-in monte-carlo simulator which gives you a P10, P50 and P90 confidence intervals for those values as well
